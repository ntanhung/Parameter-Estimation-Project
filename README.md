Parameter Estimation for Nonlinear Systems: Three SIR-Related Models.


The project is part of the 2022 summer research program with Professor Veneziani at Emory University. In the project, I used the pybobyqa library to estimate the parameters for SIR, SIRW, and SIRE models that are believed to be good estimations for the spread of COVID-19. After conducting a sensitivity analysis, this approach can only accurately estimate nonlinear systems with five or fewer parameters. A research poster, which I presented at the end of the research program, is also attached for more detailed information.
## Next Step
The ultimate goal of this research is to estimate the parameters for the SIRW2 model, which has eight parameters that can precisely forecast the spread of COVID-19 and other contagious diseases in the far future. I also tackled the problem through the Kalman Filter method, and interesting comparisons between the two methods can also be found in my newest work.
