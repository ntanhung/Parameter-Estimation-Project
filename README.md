# Parameter-Estimation-Project
Parameter Estimation for a Nonlinear System.


The project is a part of the 2022 summer research with Professor Veneziani at Emory University. In the project, I used the pybobyqa library to estimate the parameters for SIR, SIRW, and SIRE models that are believed to be good estimations for the spread of COVID-19. After conducting a sensitivity analysis, this approach can only estimate nonlinear systems with five or fewer parameters accurately. A research poster which I presented at the end of the research program is also attached for more detailed information.
## Next Step
The ultimate goal of this research is to estimate the parameters for the SIRW2 model, having eight parameters, which can forecast the spread of COVID-19 and other contagious diseases in the far future precisely. I'm currently tackling the problem through the Kalman Filter method which is hoped to give a good estimation for the SIRW2 model.
